"""The GOAT ranking: the site's own order of every Division I team.

Four things decide it, in this order of importance:
  1. head to head: a team that has beaten another is ranked above it where
     that can be done without contradicting more results than it honors;
  2. strength of schedule: the average rating of the teams it has played
     (the ratings behind the odds);
  3. the AVCA coaches poll: a ranked team gets credit for its place in it;
  4. record: its share of matches won.
Factors 2 to 4 make a score: each team's place among all Division I teams on
schedule and on record (0 at the bottom, 1 at the top) and its poll credit
((26 - rank) / 25 for a ranked team, 0 otherwise), weighted by GOAT_WEIGHTS.

The order starts from that score. Then every pair of teams has a price for
being ranked the "wrong" way round: ranking a team above one that has beaten
it costs 1 for each win the other is ahead by, and ranking it above a team
with a higher score costs the gap divided by GOAT_HEAD_TO_HEAD. The GOAT order
is the one with the lowest total price, found by moving one team at a time to
wherever it lowers the total most, until no move helps. So a win lifts a team
over the team it beat when their scores are close, but not when the gap is
wide. Results that form a circle (A beat B, B beat C, C beat A) cannot all be
honored; it keeps as many as it can.
